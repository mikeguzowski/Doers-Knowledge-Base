Great, that means you should already be familiar with taking notes!

But hold on a second. There’s no silver bullet solution that works perfectly for everyone. Obsidian works best if you care about what we care about.

Do you have any of the following concerns below?

→ [[Obsidian 101/Adventurer/Vault is just a local folder|I don’t want my notes to been seen by others]]

→ [[Obsidian 101/Adventurer/Vault is just a local folder|I don’t want my notes to be inaccessible someday]]

→ [[Obsidian 101/Adventurer/Plugins make Obsidian special for you|I feel like the previous note-taking apps I used didn’t suit me well]]

→ [[Obsidian 101/Guides/Get started with Obsidian|Just let me get started already]]
